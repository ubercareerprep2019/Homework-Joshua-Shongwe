/**I'm not well-versed on how to read through a data.csv file or implement the BST phonebook. But what I do know is that
* the time complexity of a binary search is O(log N) where as the time complexity of a search for an unsorted array boils down 
* to roughly O(N log N). Therefore the overall time to search through a BST would be significantly more efficient as 
* opposed to the overall time compelxity for a search of an unsorted array.
