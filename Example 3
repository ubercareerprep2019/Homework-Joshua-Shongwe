//File Comment: Example 3 Print Number of Levels. The following code will print the number of total levels in the given tree.

void printNumLevels(TreeNode* root){
  if(root == nullptr){
    cout << "0" << endl;
  }
  //Not sure if the levels will store the correct value due to the recursion here. 
  int levels = 1 + max(printNumLevels(root->left), printNumLevels(root->right);
  
  cout << levels << endl;
}
